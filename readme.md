# DFR Acquisition Script
This is a rudimentary acquisition script that I created as part of coursework for my digital forensics class "Management of Digital Evidence". I wrote very
robust code in Python for it. I modeled it after the many command line tools that I use in Kali Linux, meaning that it uses flags to indicate which process
should be done. It has five flags: -h, -c, -l, -r, -a and they are to create a help menu, create an acquisition of possible evidence within the local files 
on the suspect's google chrome, do a logical walkthrough of the machine, or to perform all functions, respectively.
